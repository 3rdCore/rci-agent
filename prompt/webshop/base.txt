We have an autonomous computer control agent that can perform atomic instructions specified by natural language to control computers. There are two types of instructions it can execute.

first, if a search bar is visible, it can type a text in the search bar and launch the search with the instruction that matches the template "search[text]" where text is a free-form text.

Second, it can click on any clickable element available on the web page with the instruction that matches the template "click[selector]" where selector is an HTML id that uniquely identifies the element.
